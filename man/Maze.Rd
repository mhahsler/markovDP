\title{Steward Russell's 4x3 Maze Gridworld MDP}
\format{
An object of class \link{MDP}.
}
\description{
The 4x3 maze is described in Chapter 17 of the textbook
"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (AIMA).
}
\details{
The simple maze has the following layout:

\preformatted{
    1234           Transition model:
   ######             .8 (action direction)
  1#   +#              ^
  2# # -#              |
  3#S   #         .1 <-|-> .1
   ######
}

We represent the maze states as a gridworld matrix with 3 rows and
4 columns. The states are labeled \code{s(row, col)} representing the position in
the matrix.
The # (state \code{s(2,2)}) in the middle of the maze is an obstruction and not reachable.
Rewards are associated with transitions. The default reward (penalty) is -0.04.
The start state marked with \code{S} is \code{s(3,1)}.
Transitioning to \code{+} (state \code{s(1,4)}) gives a reward of +1.0,
transitioning to \code{-} (state \code{s_(2,4)})
has a reward of -1.0. Both these states are absorbing
(i.e., terminal) states.

Actions are movements (\code{up}, \code{right}, \code{down}, \code{left}). The actions are
unreliable with a .8 chance
to move in the correct direction and a 0.1 chance to instead to move in a
perpendicular direction leading to a stochastic transition model.

Note that the problem has reachable terminal states which leads to a proper policy
(that is guaranteed to reach a terminal state). This means that the solution also
converges without discounting (\code{discount = 1}).
