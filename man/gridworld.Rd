\description{
Helper functions for gridworld MDPs to convert between state names and
gridworld positions, and for visualizing policies.
}
\details{
Gridworlds are implemented with state names \code{s(row,col)}, where
\code{row} and \code{col} are locations in the matrix representing the gridworld.
The actions are \code{"up"}, \code{"right"},  \code{"down"}, and  \code{"left"}.

\code{gridworld_init()} initializes a new gridworld creating a matrix
of states with the given dimensions. Other action names
can be specified, but they must have the same effects in the same order
as above. Unreachable states (walls) and absorbing state can be defined.
This information can be used to build a custom gridworld MDP.

Several helper functions are provided
to use states, look at the state layout, and plot policies on the
gridworld.

\code{gridworld_maze_MDP()} helps to easily define maze-like gridworld MDPs.
By default, the goal state is absorbing, but with \code{restart = TRUE}, the
agent restarts the problem at the start state every time it reaches the goal
and receives the reward. Note that this implies that the goal state itself
becomes unreachable.

\code{gridworld_animate()} applies algorithms from \code{\link[=solve_MDP]{solve_MDP()}} iteration
by iteration and visualized the state utilities. This helps to understand
how the algorithms work.
